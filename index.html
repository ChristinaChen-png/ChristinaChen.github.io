        <div class="subheading mb-5">History Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Christina Chen, and I’m a college student studying history. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by the past, particularly how historical events have shaped the world we live in today. While I enjoy learning about many aspects of history, my main passion lies in war history. The strategies, conflicts, and political decisions behind major battles captivate me, and I love exploring how warfare has evolved over time. From ancient conflicts to modern warfare, I find it fascinating to see how military tactics, weaponry, and leadership have changed throughout history.<br><br>

          Beyond just studying battles, I’m also deeply interested in the human side of war—how it affects societies, cultures, and individuals. War isn’t just about armies clashing on the battlefield; it impacts civilians, economies, and even the way people view the world. The struggles of soldiers, the resilience of those on the homefront, and the way wars have influenced global politics are all topics that intrigue me. Whether it’s reading firsthand accounts from soldiers, studying war propaganda, or analyzing the economic effects of conflicts, I enjoy understanding the bigger picture of how war shapes the world. Some of my favorite topics include the Russo-Japanese War, World War I and II, and the Second Sino-Japanese War. Each of these conflicts had a significant impact on world history and involved complex political and military strategies. The Russo-Japanese War, for example, was a turning point in global politics, proving that an Asian power could defeat a European empire. World War I introduced modern warfare and led to drastic changes in global alliances, while World War II reshaped the world order and left lasting effects that we still see today. The Second Sino-Japanese War, often overshadowed by World War II, played a crucial role in the conflict in Asia and had devastating consequences for China.<br><br>

          I’m also particularly interested in the American homefront during World War II. While much of the focus is on the battles fought overseas, I find it equally important to study how everyday people contributed to the war effort. The mobilization of industry, the role of propaganda, and the changes in daily life during wartime are all topics that I enjoy exploring. The way war impacts not just soldiers but also civilians is something I believe is often overlooked in mainstream discussions of history.

          In addition to studying history, I also enjoy coding in my free time. I love the challenge of problem-solving and creating projects that combine logic and creativity. This website will serve as a place to store my personal projects, including any history-related research, coding work, and other interests. I hope to use this space to share my thoughts, findings, and possibly connect with others who share my passion for history and technology. Anyways, both subjects do draw attention to complex details, which I like and hopefully it can make my path more exciting as I go along my way to be a historian. So, feel free to check out my website and see what attracts your attention!
